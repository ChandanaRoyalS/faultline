# Gates

`CLAUDE.md` rule 4: *"Gates are hard — a task is done when its gate condition passes from
a clean clone."* Until 2026-09-01 nothing in this repository recorded whether any gate had
ever passed, so the rule was enforced by memory. This file is that record.

A gate is **declared** only when its condition has been observed, from a clean clone, with
the evidence written down here. "Not declared" does not mean failed — it means nobody has
checked, or a known blocker stands in the way.

Conditions below are transcribed from `docs/spec/execution-plan-rev9.pdf` §1. That PDF is
authoritative; verify wording against it before relying on it.

| Gate | Condition (§1) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| G0 | CI green on an empty walking skeleton | **Declared 2026-09-01** |
| G1 | injected fault → alert fires → visible on dashboards, zero AI | Not declared |
| G2 | one alert → one agent → one persisted, rendered finding | Not declared |
| G3 | end-to-end investigation passes on 3 scenario classes | Not declared |
| G4 | one command runs and scores all 10 scenarios into a report | Not declared — blocked |
| G5 | full demo runs from clean clone; MVP tagged | Not declared — unverified |
| G6 | approval-gated remediation works; injection + storm tests pass | Not declared |
| G7 | repo + video + benchmark and ablation reports are application-ready | Not declared |

## G0 — declared 2026-09-01

Full condition: *"CI is green on the walking skeleton; a clean clone brings up an (empty)
platform with one command."*

Tested by cloning `https://github.com/ChandanaRoyalS/faultline.git` into an empty directory
and running the documented commands, with the working copy's platform brought down first so
the fixed ports (5432, 6379) were free.

- `make up` — one command. Both services reached `Up (healthy)`: `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`
  and `redis:7-alpine`.
- `uv sync` from cold — 46 packages, CPython 3.12.14, no manual step beyond what the
  README's prerequisites list.
- `make check` — ruff, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict`, pytest: **565 passed,
  5 skipped**.
- CI green on `main` at the commit tested.

**One thing the evidence qualifies.** A clean clone runs 565 tests where a developer's
working copy runs 569. The five skips are correct and each states its own reason: four
depend on `world/`, which is gitignored because it is a pinned clone of somebody else's
repository (ADR-0026), and one needs `FAULTLINE_GRAPH_DRIFT_URL` for a live drift check.
So "green from a clean clone" is true, and it tests slightly less than a local run does.
That is a property of the world being external, not a gap in the suite.

## Known blockers on later gates

Recorded here so they are not rediscovered.

**G4.** Its condition names `make eval` running all ten scenarios unattended. `make eval`
takes one `SCENARIO` per invocation and there is no all-scenarios driver; separately,
`faultline-eval` refuses rather than waits when invoked back to back, so successive calls
are rejected inside seconds. The condition also requires an A/A check declaring null, a
dev-set median time-to-report ≤ 3 minutes and cost ≤ $2 per incident, and the T4.7 baseline
suite — none of which exists yet.

**G5.** Its condition requires the full demo from a clean clone. T7.48 rebuilt the world
but reused local images and said so; no cold clone-and-pull has ever been run, and the demo
has never been executed from one.
